Unobtanium-Gamed
===============

An interactive Shakesperean game with various menus/options. This play combines three plays (Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, and A Midsummer Night's Dream) into one game in which the user travels back in time and now has the power to control how these plays end.

Created November 2013 for ENGL 1102.

To Play
=======
Run the Unobtanium Final.exe

Other notes
===========
Since I was the only cs major in the group, my tasks consisted of:
- [Gathering all the character and background images, scripts, and music for all three plays from the team members]
- [Editing the images so that multiple characters could fit on one screen]
- [Writing the entire code for the game]
- [Constantly testing the game to make sure it works in the right order]
